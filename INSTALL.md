#Install

IMAP Nilsimsa is designed to be run in either of two modes:

1. run once - i.e. `python imap_nilsima.py` (suitable for cron, at or windows scheduled tasks)
2. standalone loop - i.e. `python imap_nilsimsa.py -l 30` (run every 30 seconds

-- see `python imap_nilsimsa.py -h` for help

* Install Python 2: this is left as an exercise for the reader.  Requests for help *may* result in links to [google](https://lmgtfy.com) - you've been warned :)
* Download [the imap-nilsimsa python script]()
* expand the zip fill

-- or clone it :)

* copy included imap_autosort.conf.sample to imap_autosort.conf
* configure imap_autosoft.conf in your favourite text editor

* run it!  if you've done everything right it should just be `python imap_nilsimsa.py` as above.
